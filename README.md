# Guess-Who


Building a Guess Who game. Everybody knows the rules but still....

The player starts the game with a board that includes images of 12 people and their name. The object of the game is to determine which image has been selected (at random). The player will make various yes or no questions (or statements) to eliminate candidates, such as "Does your person wear glasses?" Images will be eliminated by having an overlay applied to them until only one is left. Well-crafted questions allow players to eliminate one or more possible cards. Questions might include:

#"Does the person wear a hat?"
#"Does the person wear glasses?"
#"Does the person have a big nose?"
